        <h1>Watching TV</h1>

        <p>
            My favorite thing to do in my free time is watch television. I am 12 years old and I am going into 7th grade. I like watching many different types of shows. Recently, I've been watching a lot of anime. Anime is a japenese animation. I can watch tv for hours, there are so many things you can see. Whenever I am bored or don't know what to do, I watch television. Television also helps calm you down or take your mind off of something.

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Many famous movies were first books. For example, The Notebook and Little Women were books before they were turned into movies. Some popular books series were also later turned into movies, such as Harry Potter, The Lord Of The Rings, and The Hunger Games.
